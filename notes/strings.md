## Changing Case in Strings

The method **title()** capitalizes the string. It appears after the variable. 

Ex: 
<pre><code>("Hello world").title()</code></pre>

✨ Methods have parentheses because they require additional information to run. On the other hand, the function title() doesn't need any additional information and is therefore left empty.

Other methods: 
**upper()**
**lower()**

You can probably guess what those do. 

✨ Note that users cannot be trusted to properly case their names/info, hence the need for these functions.

## Concatenating

concatenating - a fancy word for combining strings

Use the plus symbol to combine strings.
