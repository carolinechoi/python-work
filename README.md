# ‚ú® Python Adventure üêç

I've always wanted to learn Python, not just because the name is cool (worthy of a Cardi B song title), but because it's a simple and user-friendly language. Additionally, I want to delve into and learn more about artificial intelligence and complex algorithms.

The resources I am using are:
* *Python Crash Course*: a project-based guide by Eric Matthes.
* *MIT OpenCourseWare*: specifically, course 6.0001, "Introduction to computer science and programming in python" of Fall 2016

** Disclaimer: Because of school, I'll probably forget to update this for a few weeks at a time. So the current files in this Repo may not be up to date.
