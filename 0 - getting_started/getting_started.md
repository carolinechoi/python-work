## Running a File Via Terminal

To run a python file in your terminal, execute the command:

```bash
$ py your_file_name.py
```

## Naming Conventions

lower case, with _ dividing individual words. No camel case!

## Python Indentation

Use four spaces for indentation in functions, loops, etc. This is convention. Don't freak! ðŸ’«
